TODO:
 - For short string literal quotes are also copied.
 - Parse escape sequences inside a string: \077, \\, \n, etc.
 - Parsing a string literal prefixed with (u8|u|U|L) yields no effects of used storaging type.
 - Truncation/narrowing warnings during parsing the literals.


TODO // 23/03/015

The following produces simple logic functions:
    `gds_logic_unary'
    `gds_logic_bin'
    `gds_logic_ternary_math'
    `gds_logic_from_math'
that further are arranged into the 1/2/3-ary tree with
    `gds_logic_math'

The following is related to picewise functions and should be implemented via macro:
    `gds_parser_new_PcwsTrmList'
    `gds_PcwsTrmList_append'
with `struct PcwsTrmList' structure that keeps track the set of argument pieces until the
    `gds_math_piecewise_unite'
will be invoked in order to produce evaluable function. All the pieces are created with
    `gds_math_piecewise_term_new'
function that simply produces a temporary pair of condition/function.

This functions:
    `gds_math_new_func_from_array'
    `gds_math_new_func_from_var'
    `gds_math_new_func_from_range'
    `gds_math_substitute_function'
creates a function-like wrapper for the appropriate objects in order to smoothly embed it into
the entire math expression tree.

This creates a special `range' object:
    `gds_range_new'

This two operates with temporary associative array prototype
    `gds_asc_array_pair_new'
    `gds_asc_array_new'
that is further should be turned into real expression with:
    TODO: ???
while the
    `gds_array_subset'
is an indexing operation.
